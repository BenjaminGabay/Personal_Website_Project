        <p>I competed in the HackTX hackathon in Austin, TX. My team and I created
          a web app inspired by the company Acorn. Acorn will round up the user`s
          purchases and invest their change. Alternatively, our app was designed to
          round up the user`s purchases and then donate them to the charity of their
          choice from a selection on our site. My primary task during this project
          was setting up the back-end and data storage of the site.
        </p>
        <p>I am still open minded as to what field or specification of computer
          science I want to go into. A main interest of mine though has always been
          artificial intelligence and machine learning. So, my goals would be to do
          something with those.
        </p>
        <p>To gain some exposure to machine learning, I am involved in a research
          group with several other undergraduate and graduate students working
          with Dr. Sharon at Texas A&M. All the projects involve the use of machine
          learning in some way. Currently, my research team is designing and building
          several tracks to test different driving conditions. We then drive a small
          robotic vehicle equipped with a single centered camera around the track to
          collect data of proper driving. Finally, we use this data to build a neural
          network through imitation learning to see if the vehicle can then navigate
          the track on its own. In the future I hope to expand this project to include
          reinforced learning techniques so that prior data collection is not used, and
          the car will learn in real-time. The research lab website and list of all the
          projects being worked on can be
          found <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/guni/pistar/research.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Another side project I have been working on to better my computer science
          abilities is a social media website. I have begun to develop it with a few of
          my friends that are also computer science majors at various colleges around the
          country. As of right now I am working on both the back-end and front-end teams.
          I am self-teaching myself MongoDB and React to use for the site setup.
